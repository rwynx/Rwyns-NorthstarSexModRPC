# Rwyn's Discord Rich Presence - Customizable RPC 
### Rwyn's Northstar SexMod RPC and a blank template for you to make your own RPC.

## Usage - Make sure you have all the dependencies.
* `pip install nuitka`
* `pip install termcolor` for colored text.
* `pip install pyfiglet` alternatively you can try with `pip install pyfiglet --force` for ASCII text.
* IF YOU WANT AN ASCII TEXT on console print: pyfiglet fucked for some reason and Chrome/Windows detects this code as virus, so my advice is to build an exe it with;
`pyinstaller --add-data "Python 3.10.4\Lib\site-packages\pyfiglet;./pyfiglet" --onefile your-app-name.py`
* IF YOU DONT WANT AN ASCII TEXT on console print: just simply delete that line, otherwise exe won't work.
* I use **pyinstaller**, you can use whatever you like. But make sure you have the right parameters ^
* Original exe icon is not included in this package.

## Additional Info
* **rwyn-northstar-sexmodrpc.py** is the main project.
* You can use **"empty_template.py"** to make a customized RPC.
* Everything you need to change addressed in the template.
